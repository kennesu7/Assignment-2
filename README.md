Features of my web app:
1. Ability to create a user, add a name, weight (lb), height (cm), hairColor and GPA(max 4.0)
2. Ability to show all the users in the database. The users are repsresnted by rectangles with the size of the rectangle being relative to the users height and weight. Addditionally based on the haircolor of the user, the border color will also change,
3. for instance if the user's hair color is red then the border color is also red
4. The ability to edit a user based on their UID. This can be done in 2 ways, one way is by navigating to the edit page which will prompt for a uid and once submited the user will be taken to a forum with the fields
5. of the user filled out, from there the users name, weight, height etc. can be updated. The other way is by clicking on their name in the showAll page which will redirect to the update form with the users name, height,weight etc.already filled out
6. The last feature is the ability to delete a user based on their UID, since some users can have the same name I decided to use a users unique uid to find and delete them from the database.
